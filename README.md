## ASM_clust

This repository contains the scripts for a python implementation of ASM_clust. The "prelim" directory contains the slower and less effective implementation described in Speth and Orphan, biorxiv, 2019.

The script and notebook are functional in the conda environment described in the yml file, but generally this python implementation isn't designed to be broadly useable yet.
